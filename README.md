#Project: Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree

In this project, I present my code submissions of the nanodegree program "Self-Driving Car Engineer".
This git repository is currently organized as follows, according to the three terms in the SDCE ND:

<pre><code>
 |-Term1
 |---Project1_Finding_Lane_Lines_On_The_Road
 |---Project2_Traffic_Sign_Classifier_Project
 |-Term2
 |-Term3
</code></pre>

Each folder Term1/2/3 contains the subfolders for the projects, and each project subfolder contains the files necessary for each submission.
As progressing through the ND, more subfolders will be added, of course.

I started the ND in Dec, 2017 and will finish it 9 months later.

EDIT: Due to a job change in 2018, I had no time for the Nanodegree and had to restart. Therefore, I switched the cohort to Jul 2018 (which is possible for one time).

In case you are a Udacity student: please obey the Udacity codex, this repository is exclusively for the Udacity reviewers.
